Seth Godin may be a genius.  Or he just curates a lot of good ideas other people have.  Maybe both.

He used to describe himself as a marketer and looks like he has updated that profile to describe himself as a teacher.  I can't disagree.  I've followed his blog on-and-off for years and read many of his books.

My desktop background was a purple cow for a brief period.

It stuck out to me that he often has a short quote that I want to share because quality assurance is about maintaining and improving value.

> Over time, the value of a uniform, a brand or a platform is defined by the worst people who wear it or use it.

Sometimes it's just the whole article that resonates.
