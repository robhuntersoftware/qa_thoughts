I once worked with a manager (not my manager, the manager of a different department) that hold me that my job (as QA coordinator) was to make sure the software was "bug free".

Beyond not having the technical resources that would be required for such a feat, nor the authority, it also misses the point.

In most software bugs will exist and that's okay.  I have mostly worked in commercial software, meaning either the software is licensed out to make revenue or the software platform is licensed for use to make revenue.  The point here is that the software's root purpose is to make revenue.  If there are bugs that don't affect that purpose, then from a purely business point of view, it would be a waste of resources to fix those bugs.

Of course the real world is messier and is more grey than black and white, but QA teams are information gatherers and whistle blowers, not blockers.
