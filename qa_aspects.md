I have started calling myself a QA Engineering Lead.
It's a bit of a story coming up with that title.

Technically I do QA/QC, but QC is so limited in both scope and process that it hardly deserving of being included with the word engineering.
QC is testing that stuff that is done is done to spec. It feels like a very waterfall approach to ensuring quality. In mass production it's important that each produced item meets the specific criteria, and essentially all produced items are identical.
But software is different. We iterate. Many specs are flexible. We don't want identical copies of the same thing.

We want high quality user experiences.  We want performance.  We want efficiency.  We want security.  We want maintainability.
We want to be better than the competition.

QA encompasses all the -ilities that need to be accounted for from the inception of any new development through to the retirement of whatever feature was created.

We're Agile!  What does that mean for software QA?
A good analogy (and who doesn't love those) is being like a software 'aspect' to a program.

Definition from Wikipedia:
>  Aspect (computer programming) An aspect of a program is a feature linked to many other parts of the program, but which is not related to the program's primary function. An aspect crosscuts the program's core concerns, therefore violating its separation of concerns that tries to encapsulate unrelated functions

QA crosscuts every part of the software development lifecycle.  It requires breadth and depth of domain and product knowledge.  It requires being devil's advocate in design and planning.  Challenging assumptions.  Putting solutions through their paces.  Breaking things!
And still having a good working relationship with your team.
